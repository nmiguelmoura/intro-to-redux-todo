# Redux exercise 02

We have a TODO app with some questionable design choices in place. The app is working but is not quite scalable at the moment.

A new requirement comes in asking us to include a header with the app name and a count of all incomplete todos.

We can take this opportunity to manage the todos through a redux store and perhaps do some refactoring (ex: split the AddTodo from the Todos component).
